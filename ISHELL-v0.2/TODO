To-do list
==========

1.) Figure out some way to display a '# ' after each command.
2.) Add sequence number handling (was already in this version, but I
    removed it for various reasons)
2.) Make the server allocate a pseudo device for the client.
3.) Add user authentication.
4.) Encrypt the data in the packet.
